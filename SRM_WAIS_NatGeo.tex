\begin{abstract}
Solar radiation management (SRM) via injection of sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere has garnered attention for its potential to reduce the climate impacts of global warming, including sea level rise (SLR). However, dynamical influences on SLR that arise from the combination of stratospheric sulfate aerosols and tropospheric greenhouse gases have not been considered, and may cause nonlinear behavior in subsurface ocean temperatures. Here we investigate in a fully-coupled global climate model (GCM) whether rapidly increasing stratospheric sulfate aerosol concentrations will not only reverse steric sea level rise, but also preserve Antarctic ice sheets, avoiding sea level rise due to mass input. We contrast this SRM method with an idealized scenario in which all greenhouse gases (GHG) are returned to preindustrial levels. We find that the rapid addition of a stratospheric aerosol layer does not effectively counteract upper and surface level atmospheric circulation changes caused by increasing greenhouse gases. Anomalous surface westerlies impose a stress on the Southern Ocean that causes Ekman pumping of relatively warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) to the level of ice shelves. The large-scale oceanic environment under stratospheric sulfate aerosols thus leaves open the possibility of ice sheet destabilization through increased basal melt even in the absence of large atmospheric warming, providing a potentially large source of sea level rise. Meanwhile, removal of atmospheric greenhouse gases restores the wind stress on the ocean, yielding relatively cooler subsurface ocean temperatures.

%\section{Introduction}

The retreat of the Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers are believed to be unstoppable, with a rapid collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) expected within as little as a few centuries \cite{joughin14,rignot14}. The mass contribution to SLR from such a collapse is thought to compare with or even exceed the steric SLR (check@@).  A reasonable question is whether SRM might buy time and delay a WAIS collapse or possibly even prevent a WAIS collapse by returning the WAIS climate to a colder time, while at the same time avoiding steric SLR.

A large amount of mass loss from ice sheets occurs due to basal melt of their ice shelves \cite{joughin11}, the floating extensions of land ice sheets. In West Antarctica, the face of these ice shelves extend from the surface to several hundred meters depth, near the level of the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). The CDW is a subsurface water mass that is slightly warmer than waters above and below it (-1$^\circ$C to 1$^\circ$C; \cite{yin11}). An increase in the temperature of CDW or an increase in the rate that CDW is brought onto the continental shelf due to regional wind variability can greatly increase basal melting of ice shelves \cite{thoma08,joughin11}, causing ice shelf thinning and a subsequent reduction in the buttressing stress, leading to an increase in ice stream velocity \cite{oppenheimer98}. In short, a small warming of CDW, or a greater propensity for it to encroach on continental shelves, has the potential to cause ice shelf disintegration even in the absence of large atmospheric warming \cite{oppenheimer98}. %, in addition to calving and surface melt

SRM may be able to reduce global mean temperature (e.g., \cite{kravitz13}), but it cannot reduce temperature equivalently at all places and all times \cite{bala08,ricke10}, especially not in the ocean interior \cite{mccusker12}. Regional disparities are particularly high in the polar regions owing to coupled mechanisms involving high horizontal and vertical ocean heat transport \cite{mccusker12} and the response of the atmospheric and oceanic circulation to forcing by various types of intended and unintended anthropogenic contributions \cite{ammann10,mccusker12}. @@timescales?

%Stratospheric sulfate injections may be effective at reducing climate changes due to increased greenhouse gases in that the strategy reduces global averaged temperature and precipitation in many numerical models (e.g., \cite{kravitz13}), although not equivalently \cite{bala08}. Regional disparities also remain \cite{ricke10}, including limited success at eliminating climate change  in the polar regions for a variety of reasons \cite{mccusker12}. Inhomogeneities arise due to differences in the dynamical responses of the atmosphere to forcing by stratospheric aerosols and forcing by increased carbon dioxide \cite{ammann10,mccusker12}. Finally, a single rate of solar radiation management implementation cannot equally avoid changes in components of the climate system with different response timescales, such as surface temperature and sea level rise \cite{irvine12} (because thermosteric sea level rise significantly lags a radiative forcing increase and its associated surface temperature response; e.g., \cite{wigley06,solomon10}). 

To promptly avoid sea level rise in the face of rising greenhouse gases then, a large and rapid shock of stratospheric aerosols would need to be deployed to stop and reverse heat uptake by the ocean. The amount of aerosols that would be necessary depends on the flux imbalance at the surface (i.e., for how long greenhouse gases (GHGs) accumulate in the atmosphere before initiating climate engineering) and so delayed implementation requires greater solar radiation management (SRM) to immediately counter rising sea levels. Moreover, delayed implementation would yield additional deep ocean heat storage, which may linger at intermediate depths indefinitely \cite{gillett11}. Thermal expansion is not the only mechanism by which sea level can change, however. Ocean volume is modified by density changes due to changes in temperature and salinity, and due to mass inputs including ice sheet melt. Observed sea level rise in recent decades is attributed primarily to thermal expansion, however contributions from runoff and ice sheet melt are expected to grow in the future as surface and ocean warming continue \cite{bindoff07}. 

Curbing sea level rise via SRM has been explored using observed relationships between the response of sea level to volcanic eruptions \cite{moore10}, which have been observed to transiently lower sea level \cite{church05,gleckler06}, and by examining the steric height changes in an intermediate complexity climate model \cite{irvine12}; Irvine et al. (2012) additionally include the contribution to sea level from mass input with a scaling to the global mean surface temperature anomaly. These studies find that SRM, including with stratospheric aerosol injection, would reduce the rate of global mean sea level rise. However, changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation, which can have significant impacts on both surface and basal melting of ice sheets and shelves \cite{steig13,joughin11,thoma08}, were not accounted for in the aforementioned studies. The subsurface temperature structure of the Southern Ocean is largely determined by the surface wind stress \cite{fyfe07}, which in turn is set by the circumpolar westerly jet. McCusker et al. (2012) showed in a set of idealized simulations that when climate is transiently stabilized using a stratospheric sulfate layer that counteracts growing CO$_2$ concentrations, a residual anomalous poleward-intensified zonal wind stress on the Southern Ocean remains that causes upwelling of warmer subsurface waters to the level of ice sheet outlets. Warmed subsurface ocean waters that destabilize marine ice sheets may introduce nonlinear or threshold behavior \cite{notz09} such that sea level change calculations underestimate the amount of rise for a given surface warming.

Realistically, should SRM be utilized, it will likely be after a period of global warming that is deemed to be unacceptably large. Can a rapid implementation of sulfate SRM preserve Antarctic ice sheets and curb potential sea level rise? This question is particularly timely as there are indications that a West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) marine instability is already upon us \cite{favier14,rignot14}. Here we investigate with a global climate model the impact of a rapidly increased stratospheric sulfate aerosol burden on the high latitudes of the southern hemisphere (SH), focusing in particular on residual atmospheric circulation changes and associated response in the subsurface ocean. We contrast these results with an idealized scenario in which greenhouses gases are abruptly returned to preindustrial levels --- the ultimate, if not idealized, climate engineering. 

\section{Sea level rise and atmospheric circulation}

The time evolution of global mean surface air temperature (SAT) for business-as-usual (RCP8.5) and climate engineering scenarios is shown in Figure \ref{fig:gmts}a. Sulf (blue) represents a scenario in which drastic climate engineering is required to stop sea levels from further rising, and hence entails a quick and large decrease in net radiative forcing via a rapid increase in stratospheric aerosol burden. This decrease in radiative forcing accomplishes a large amount of avoided warming compared to business-as-usual (Figure \ref{fig:gmts}a; RCP8.5 in red). The global and annual mean SAT linear trend for the first decade following the start of SRM (years 2036-2045) is -0.94$^\circ$C/decade for the ensemble mean, and the land-only trend is even greater at -1.2 $^\circ$C/decade. As such, Sulf returns global mean SAT to roughly the end of the 20th century average (1970-1999) by the following decade (2045-2054; SAT anomaly of -0.03$^\circ$C) and is much cooler than RCP8.5, which is 1.83$^\circ$C warmer than the end of the 20th century at that time. An instantaneous removal of GHGs to preindustrial conditions (GHGrem in green) is reasonably comparable to Sulf, yielding a slightly overcooled SAT of -0.36$^\circ$C for 2045-2054 compared to the 1970-1999 average. % SFCFLUX here? @@ % ; Table \ref{tbl:means}

Accordingly, global average sea level due to changes in ocean density (representing temperature and salinity changes only) reverses its rising course and starts declining upon initiation of climate engineering (Figure \ref{fig:gmts}b). Nearly 30 cm of sea level rise is avoided by century's end when a sulfate layer is implemented, consistent with previous findings \cite{irvine12}. Thus, assuming no nonlinear or threshold behavior in the contribution of mass input from land ice melt, a high rate of sulfate injection could promptly reduce or avoid sea level rise, at the expense of high SAT trends. %We now turn to the Southern Hemisphere surface and subsurface ocean environment in the context of heat available for melting in ice sheet outlet regions.  % \footnote{Steric sea level change is computed as: $\eta^n = H((\rho_0 / \rho_n) -1)$, where $\eta^n$ is the change in surface elevation at timestep $n$, $H$ is the global mean ocean depth, $\rho_0$ is the `baseline' global mean ocean density from the 20thC simulation averaged over 1970-1999, and $\rho_n$ is global mean density at timestep $n$. Ocean density, $\rho$, is primarily modified by changes in ocean temperature, but is also affected by changes in salinity. This calculation assumes no volume change due to freshwater input (e.g., precipitation, evaporation, river runoff, melting and freezing of sea ice), including neglecting inputs from melting ice sheets, which are not included in the model.}% \citep{mccuskerinprep}
%Quickramp, a goal of which might be to immediately curb sea level rise, does just so and nearly returns steric sea level to 20thC by 2095, at the expense of rapid land SAT trends of almost -1$^\circ$C/decade at the start of SRM.

%\subsection{Atmospheric circulation anomalies}

Numerical simulations of SRM with stratospheric aerosols have shown residual SH poleward intensified winds induced by differences in the vertical temperature structure of a stratospheric sulfate layer versus well-mixed tropospheric carbon dioxide \cite{ammann10,mccusker12}. These temperature anomalies and corresponding upper atmosphere and surface wind changes share features with those induced by ozone depletion \cite{gillett03,gillett13,sigmond11,thompson11} and increasing greenhouse gases \cite{gillett13,sigmond11,polvani11}. Although mechanisms and structural details differ somewhat depending on the type of upper atmospheric forcing, the fundamental cause is the same: zonal wind shear is modified via thermal wind balance altered by an anomalous increase in the stratospheric pole-to-equator temperature gradient. Strengthened SH lower stratospheric/upper tropospheric winds are then associated with increased eastward eddy propagation, which in turn shifts the critical latitude for Rossby wave breaking poleward, leading to poleward shifted surface westerlies \cite{chen07}.%@@thompson%In the case of stratospheric geoengineering, the vertical zonal mean temperature and zonal wind structure is a confluence of strong tropical lower stratospheric heating due to aerosols and high latitude stratospheric cooling due to GHGs (neglecting the impact of ozone), with little change in the troposphere (cf. Figure 5 from \citet{mccusker12}).  %confluence of a greatly poleward shifted polar vortex due to aerosols with less shifted but greater strengthening due to

When aerosols are quickly increased in the stratosphere, large vertical temperature anomalies are generated (Figure \ref{fig:vert}a). The vertical zonal mean temperature structure is a combination of strong tropical lower stratospheric heating due to aerosols \cite{ferraro11} and high latitude stratospheric cooling due to GHGs, with little change in the tropospheric temperature. The resultant zonal winds show a strengthened SH polar vortex and slight weakening of the subtropical jet (Figure \ref{fig:vert}b). %  wherein climate is instead stabilized with a stratospheric sulfate layer, with associated zonal mean zonal wind changes. % ; also compare with Figure 5c from \citet{mccusker12}

The upper atmospheric deviations result in surface wind and wind stress anomalies in the SH that are comparable to those in the RCP8.5 business-as-usual scenario: they are poleward-shifted and intensified, and of similar magnitude (Figures \ref{fig:shmaps}d, \ref{fig:shmaps}e, and \ref{fig:zmtautemp}a). In contrast, when GHGs are removed from the atmosphere, the surface wind stress has very nearly returned to 20thC values (Figure \ref{fig:shmaps}f and \ref{fig:zmtautemp}a). Additionally, while both climate engineering strategies cause the sea ice edge to recover to the 20thC position (15\% concentration contours shown in Figure \ref{fig:shmaps}d-f), annual average sea ice concentration near sea ice margins remains lower by up to 15\% in Sulf, but are increased beyond 20thC concentrations by almost 10\% in GHGrem (not shown). The residual sea ice concentration anomalies in Sulf and GHGrem are echoed in the residual temperature anomalies: Figure \ref{fig:shmaps}b shows a small local warming accompanies the reduced sea ice concentration in Sulf, while Figure \ref{fig:shmaps}c shows weak local cooling accompanies the small increase in sea ice concentration in  GHGrem. % This is quite unlike SAT, which is much cooler in Sulf than the business-as-usual scenario (Figures \ref{fig:shmaps}a and \ref{fig:shmaps}b). %(@@consider adding geomip and/or ECHAM here? or appendix?) 
%We note, however, that both climate engineering strategies yield temperature anomalies that are far reduced from the business-as-usual scenario (Figure \ref{fig:shmaps}a).% note that in my CCSM3 results: the aero run has pronounced *decreased* zonal winds over the southern ocean. the stratospheric vortex is strengthened but it's further south than when increased CO2 is also included. 
%Similar vertical temperature anomalies exist when aerosols are quickly increased in the stratosphere in Quickramp (not shown), resulting in zonal mean zonal wind anomalies that rival those in the business-as-usual scenario.  --- that is, poleward intensified zonal mean zonal winds. This is especially evident in the Southern Hemisphere, with a

\section{Implications for Antarctic ice sheets}
% @@ notes 9/2/2014: Global mean temp for Sulf and GHGrem are similar by year 2060. Comparing the zonal mean TEMP anomalies with depth in year 2060, Sulf shows minor cooling in the surface layer in SO whereas GHGrem has cooling down to greater than 500m. Additionally global mean TOA and OSHF are comparable in the two runs almost immediately (within 5 years) -- implying that the global mean forcings in the two run are comparable right away. However, the southern hemisphere (southern ocean & SH SAT) in the two runs shows very different evolutions. @@calculate a TEMP trend in a SO box in the two runs (say, 200m-500m and ~60S-77S).

%A large amount of mass loss from ice sheets occurs due to basal melt of their ice shelves \cite{joughin11}, the floating extensions of land ice sheets. In West Antarctica, the face of these ice shelves extend from the surface to several hundred meters depth, near the level of the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW). The CDW is a subsurface water mass that is slightly warmer than waters above and below it (-1$^\circ$C to 1$^\circ$C; \cite{yin11}). An increase in the temperature of CDW or an increase in the rate that CDW is brought onto the continental shelf due to regional wind variability can greatly increase basal melting of ice shelves \cite{thoma08,joughin11}, causing ice shelf thinning and a subsequent reduction in the buttressing stress, leading to an increase in ice stream velocity \cite{oppenheimer98}.

Both climate engineering scenarios presented here in Sulf and GHGrem greatly reduce the surface warming in Antarctica that is seen in the RCP8.5 scenario --- over 100\% in the case of GHGrem (compare Figure \ref{fig:shmaps}b and \ref{fig:shmaps}c with \ref{fig:shmaps}a) --- but the significant amount of ocean heat uptake that occurred over the first third of the 21st century before climate engineering was initiated (not shown) also poses a threat to Antarctic ice sheets, particularly the WAIS, whose grounding line is below sea level \cite{joughin11} and retreating \cite{rignot14}. %We thus turn to the temperature structure below the ocean's surface in the vicinity of the Antarctic coast.  % Figure \ref{fig:energyts}b

%Southern Ocean subsurface temperature for the end of the 20th century, averaged over the 200-500 m layer is shown in Figure \ref{fig:shsubtemp}a. Mean simulated temperatures generally average between about -1$^\circ$C and 1$^\circ$C along the coastline, slightly higher than the freezing point of seawater (-1.8$^\circ$C). 

Small ocean temperature perturbations can have a significant impact on basal melting of ice shelves; a warming of just 0.1$^\circ$C can thin 1 m of ice shelf in a year \cite{rignot02}. Zonally averaged Southern Ocean temperature anomalies in Sulf indicate that temperatures encroaching on the ice shelves average 0.15-0.20$^\circ$C warmer than 20thC (Figure \ref{fig:zmtautemp}c), which is already a few tenths of a degree warmer than simulated preindustrial conditions (not shown). Drastic reduction of greenhouse gases, however, show zonal mean temperature near the level of ice shelves is up to 0.25$^\circ$C cooler than in Sulf (Figure \ref{fig:zmtautemp}d). Were all of this average extra heat in Sulf to go into basal melt, reducing GHGs rather than deploying stratospheric aerosols would result in 2.5 meters of ``preserved" ice shelf thickness each year. 

%Utilizing stratospheric aerosols to curb global temperatures yields residual ocean warming in the 200-500m layer equal to 0.2-0.3$^\circ$C in many Antarctic coastal locations (not shown).

%Drastic reduction of greenhouse gases, however, exhibits smaller residual subsurface warming, particularly near west Antarctica (with the exception of the Weddell Sea, which has similar residual warming in the two scenarios; Figure \ref{fig:shsubtemp}e).

The anomalous mid-depth warmth evident south of about 65$^\circ$S and between 200-400m depth in Sulf (Figure \ref{fig:zmtautemp}c) can be understood as anomalous upwelling of relatively warm CDW. This upwelling is caused by increased Ekman pumping that originates from the previously discussed poleward-intensified zonal winds (Figures \ref{fig:shmaps}e) caused by stratospheric aerosols, greenhouse gases \cite{fyfe07}, and their combination here (Figure \ref{fig:zmtautemp}a). Sulfate engineering exhibits a more contracted and slightly weaker region of westerly stress anomaly compared to if no geoengineering were applied (RCP8.5), and exhibits greater easterly stress than RCP8.5 equatorward of about 55$^\circ$S (Figure \ref{fig:zmtautemp}a). The curl of the wind stress shows the regions of anomalous upwelling and downwelling in RCP8.5 are retained in Sulf (Figure \ref{fig:zmtautemp}b). %@@rework this and next 2 para

The mid-depth residual warming resembles the 'slow timescale' response to an increase in ozone forcing described in \cite{ferreira14}, wherein Southern Ocean circulation adjusts to changes in atmospheric winds and causes ocean warming from below that overcomes initial SST cooling and sea ice growth on the time scale of decades. Thus, engineering by sulfate aerosols features anomalous upwelling (downwelling) poleward (equatorward) of 60$^\circ$S -- just as in the RCP8.5 scenario (albeit with slightly smaller upwelling than in RCP8.5). In contrast, the removal of GHGs causes a reversal of sign in the zonal wind stress and wind stress curl anomalies compared to the anomalies associated with RCP8.5, resulting in weak anomalous downwelling south of 60$^\circ$S (Figure \ref{fig:zmtautemp}b), which results in the cooling of the 200-400m layer past the 20th century mean (Figure \ref{fig:zmtautemp}d). % and no anomalous warming south of 75$^\circ$S near ice shelves (Figure \ref{fig:zmtautemp}d). The removal of GHGs causes the

Although not germane to the stability of Antarctic ice sheets, it is interesting to note the disparate temperature profiles equatorward of 60$^\circ$S between Sulf and GHGrem as well. The warming evident equatorward of 60$^\circ$S at all depths in Sulf is a combination of residual warmth from pre-geoengineering, a poleward shift (fundamentally due to the atmospheric jet shift) of the nearly vertical isotherms there, and increased downwelling of warmer surface waters. This feature is noticeably absent when GHGs are instead removed from the atmosphere because the jet rapidly returns to the 20thC position, resulting in weak upwelling anomalies equatorward of 60$^\circ$S. Thus the warming equatorward of ~60$^\circ$S is also due to the changes in the atmospheric winds due to the net forcing of increased CO$_2$ and sulfate aerosols.%These characteristics reinforce the importance of atmospheric wind changes on subsurface ocean temperatures.

These results show that in the zonal mean Southern Ocean, the large-scale oceanic environment remains conducive to basal melting of ice shelves when stratospheric sulfate injections are implemented, but not when GHGs are removed. Examining the most at-risk ice sheet region in Antarctica, the Amundsen Sea Embayment sector including Pine Island Glacier (PIG), reveals an even greater potential for melting under sulfate climate engineering than in the zonal average: the Sulf ensemble features an anomalous residual warming of 0.5$^\circ$C in the 200-500m layer (Figure \ref{fig:pigtemp}a). In contrast, removal of GHGs is effective at cooling the subsurface ocean up to 0.5$^\circ$C, a differential of 1$^\circ$C or 10m of potential ice shelf thickness per year between the two climate engineering methods. Eulerian, eddy, and total components of the vertical advection tendency (in units of $W/m^2$) averaged from 65-74$^\circ$S are shown with depth in Figure \ref{fig:pigtemp}c. There is an increase in temperature due to vertical advection throughout the water column under sulfate engineering (negative values) whereas removal of GHGs causes a decrease (due to the Eulerian component). The primary driver of these disparate tendency profiles is a vertical velocity ($w$) response of opposing signs (Figure \ref{fig:pigtemp}d), primarily Eulerian, acting on a temperature gradient that features an increase in temperature with increasing depth in these layers (Figure \ref{fig:pigtemp}e). %Anomalous temperature equatorward of 65$^\circ$S is explained by the same mechanisms previously described for Figure \ref{fig:zmtautemp}.  %The behavior under sulfate engineering is akin to the 'slow' timescale response to an increase in ozone forcing described in \citet{ferreira14}, wherein warming from below takes years to decades to overcome initial SST cooling and sea ice growth.
%Both scenarios are initiated from a common climate state after the global mean temperature warmed about 1$^\circ$C, and are compared to each other when their global average SAT anomalies are comparable. Atmospheric circulation and hence oceanic circulations respond 
%The primary cause of the contrasting results in the Southern Ocean more broadly, and the PIG region specifically is the disparate response of atmospheric circulation.

\section{Discussion}

% sea ice generation that produces dense salty water plays a role in getting warm CDW up onto continental shelves (see Joughin11, ocean instability section)

% @@ say more about the first section of the paper: timescales.....
SRM using stratospheric aerosols has been suggested as a `backstop' measure that could be rapidly deployed to avoid so-called climate emergencies, one of which is sea level rise due to destabilization of marine ice sheets \cite{blackstock09}. Here we show that while the rapid addition of stratospheric sulfate aerosols may immediately stop and reverse global mean steric sea level rise at the expense of large land SAT trends, it does not counteract circulation changes that make warmer subsurface waters more available for basal melting of ice shelves around Antarctica. Because these circulation changes are fundamentally due to modification of the stratospheric meridional temperature gradient through the combination of sulfate aerosol deployment and increased GHGs, these circulation changes persist for as long as GHGs and sulfates are in the atmosphere, significantly delaying both surface and subsurface cooling over and in the Southern Ocean (not shown). We also find that, alternatively, reducing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere does counterbalance circulation changes and is hence significantly more effective at cooling the Southern Ocean, and especially the region encompassing Antarctica's largest contributor to sea level rise \cite{shepherd12}: the already unstable Pine Island Glacier outlet \cite{rignot14}. Given that the PIG grounding line is currently retreating along a retrograde bed, its reversibility may only be achievable with significant reductions in basal melt rate past present day rates \cite{favier14} --- a task only removal of GHGs can accomplish based on our results.

%One implication of our results is that the more ocean heat uptake that occurs prior to the start of SRM, the greater the risk of warmer waters encroaching on ice shelves even after SRM commences. %These results can be extrapolated to include marine outlet glaciers in Greenland, which SRM has previously been shown via surface mass balance calculations to effectively preserve \citep{irvine09}. However, basal melt is also very important to the health of the Greenland ice sheet, and has been implicated as the cause of the recent acceleration of its outlet glaciers (e.g., \cite{dholland08}). Thus, subsurface ocean conditions must also be considered in evaluating the ability of stratospheric aerosols or SRM in general to preserve the Greenland ice sheet.

We emphasize that surface and subsurface temperatures are undoubtedly cooler when stratospheric aerosols are in use than under business-as-usual warming. However, while general circulation models such as the one we employ do not resolve ice shelves and sub-scale processes that influence their thickness (e.g., small-scale mixing, tidal currents; \cite{joughin11}), we have shown that the large-scale oceanic environment under stratospheric sulfate aerosols after a period of warming would be favorable for further thinning of Antarctic ice shelves, particularly in the at-risk PIG region. Furthermore, the more ocean heat uptake that occurs prior to the start of SRM, the greater the risk of warmer waters encroaching on ice shelves even after SRM commences.

Thus, while the injection of stratospheric aerosols may be effective at avoiding some eventual climate impacts due to global warming, this strategy may not be effective at avoiding one of the oft cited climate ``emergencies": destabilization of the West Antarctic ice sheet. Given the host of potential problems already associated with stratospheric aerosol injections --- including but not limited to ozone depletion \cite{tilmes08,heckendorn09}, risk of extreme regional temperature trends upon cessation (e.g., \cite{mccusker14}), continued ocean acidification \cite{feely04}, and reduced precipitation (e.g., \cite{bala08}) --- our results contribute further evidence as to why a reduction in GHGs is a much more highly desirable solution. % This may especially be the case if the WAIS is observed to already be destabilizing before stratospheric sulfates are deployed. Preemptive deployment might then avoid this risk, however we have also shown that a reduction in greenhouse gases would be more effective at preserving WAIS.

%\section{Methods}

In order to capture the relevant range of climate system timescales and dynamical feedbacks, we use the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4, \cite{gent11}), a global climate model (GCM) with a finite volume 0.9$^\circ$x1.25$^\circ$ resolution atmosphere coupled to a 1$^\circ$ full-depth ocean, sea-ice, and land models. The full-depth ocean is required in order to obtain a more realistic regional response \cite{mccusker12} and to incorporate the long timescales stemming from heat exchange with the deep ocean. %We simulate two SRM climate engineering scenarios that bookend possible scenarios that could be implemented in the future. 

Two simulations from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) are used as controls: the Climate Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) ``business-as-usual" scenario, called Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5), reaching a radiative forcing from greenhouse gas emissions of 8.5 W/m$^{2}$ above preindustrial levels by 2100, and the 20th century simulation (20thC) forced with historical greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions plus volcanic eruptions. The climate engineering simulations are branched from RCP8.5 at year 2035 when the global mean surface air temperature (SAT) is approximately 1$^\circ$C greater than that of the end of the 20th century average (computed for years 1970-1999). In year 2035, a prescribed stratospheric sulfate aerosol burden (as in \cite{mccusker12} and \cite{mccusker14}) is commenced that is ramped up from zero at a rapid rate of increase. The scenario has 3 years of rapid ramping at 8 teragrams of sulfate (SO$_4$) per year (Tg/yr), followed by ramping at 0.67 Tg/yr for the remainder of the simulation (calculated to provide a roughly equal and opposite radiative forcing to the RCP8.5 scenario transiently). %The Slowramp scenario has 50 years of `slow' ramping at 1.1 Tg/yr. After 50 years, the quick and slow scenarios reach approximately the same sulfate burden, and ramp together at 0.67 Tg/yr for the remainder of the simulations. % The right panel of Figure \ref{fig:tsts} displays the sulfate ramping scenarios.

We conducted an ensemble of four sulfate engineering simulations, initialized from four RCP8.5 ensemble members. Henceforth, we will refer to the ensemble average as Sulf. We contrast the sulfate engineering scenario with an idealized representation of complete mitigation and carbon sequestration by conducting one simulation, called GHGrem, in which greenhouse gases (CO$_2$, CH$_4$, N$_2$O, and CFCs 11 and 12) are abruptly set to year 1850 levels in the year 2035. Unless otherwise noted, anomalies are presented as the departures of the average response (Sulf, GHGrem, and RCP8.5) in years 2045-2054 from the 1970-1999 average from the 20thC simulation.%Epoch means considered in the present analysis are for years 1970-1999 of 20thC and years 2045-2054 of Quickramp, Slowramp, GHGrem, and RCP8.5, unless otherwise noted. %The 'quick' rate of increase amounts to a 2.67 teragrams of sulfur equivalent (TgS) increase per year for the first 3 years, followed by a smaller rate of about 0.28 TgS per year, so that it provides a roughly equal and opposite radiative forcing to the \textit{rcp8.5} scenario transiently until the end of the simulation in year 2095. The 'slow' rate is equal to a constant rate of increase of 0.37 TgS per year for 50 years, followed by 10 years of the same rate as quickramp, 0.28 TgS.  %@@Add something about how these amounts compare to Pinatubo. @@ Need to update figs w/ slowramp to have ensemble data.
